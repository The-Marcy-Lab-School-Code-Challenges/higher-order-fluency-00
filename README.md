# Code Challenge: High-Order Array Methods

## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to AWS Cloud9. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Problems 

1. Write a function named `sum` that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.
    
    ```jsx
    const numbers = [22, 15, 1114, 416, 37, 4]
    sum(numbers) // 1608
    ```

2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array of the the absolute values:
```js
absolute([4, -2, 7, 9, -4, -3]); // [4, 2, 7, 9, 4, 3]
```

3. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the perfect squares:
```js
findSquares([1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 25]); // [1, 4, 9, 25]
```

4. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and determines whether all numbers are even.
```js
areAllEven([1, 3, 4, 6]); // false
areAllEven([10, 32, 4, 6]); // true
```
